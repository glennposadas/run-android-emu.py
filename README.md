# run-android-emu.py
A one liner python script to run your existing Android emulator without opening your Android Studio.

Simply execute `python run_emu.py`. 

This is just a quick share of how you can execute shell commands with Python. I don't know Python and I don't use it in any self projects or production projects, but it's surely fun to learn.
